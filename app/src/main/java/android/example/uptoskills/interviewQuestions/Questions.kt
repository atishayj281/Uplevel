PEP 8 stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, it can be defined as a document that helps us to provide the guidelines on how to write the Python code. It is basically a set of rules that specify how to format Python code for maximum readability. It was written by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw and Nick Coghlan in 2001.",

    val java = arrayListOf<String>("Ques. 1 What is Java?\nAns. Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in June 1991. It can also be known as the platform as it provides its own JRE and API.")

    val cpp = arrayListOf<String>("Ques. What are the advantages of C++?\n" +
            "Ans. C++ doesn't only maintains all aspects from C language, it also simplifies memory management and adds several features like:\n" +
            "\nC++ is a highly portable language means that the software developed using C++ language can run on any platform.\n" +
            "C++ is an object-oriented programming language which includes the concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.\n" +
            "C++ has the concept of inheritance. Through inheritance, one can eliminate the redundant code and can reuse the existing classes.\n" +
            "Data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs so that the program cannot be attacked by the invaders.\n" +
            "Message passing is a technique used for communication between the objects.\n" +
            "C++ contains a rich function library.")
